//! Shared per-process runtime artifacts: the wasmtime engine and the

//! Policy compilation is expensive (OCI pull + wac fusion + Cranelift

//! pinned `(policy, plugin-set)` — is cached and reused across every

//! folds two tiers behind one [`get_or_compute`](PolicyCache::get_or_compute):
//! an in-RAM L1 and a broker-backed L2 (sealed cwasm) that survives a TEE
//! restart.
